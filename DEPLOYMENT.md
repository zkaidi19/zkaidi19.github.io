# 🚀 Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

Your personal website is now ready for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages at `https://zkaidi19.github.io`!

## 📋 Quick Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add personal website with GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub (make sure you're on main branch)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: GitHub Pages (Automatic!)
For `{username}.github.io` repositories, **GitHub Pages is automatically enabled!**

No configuration needed - GitHub automatically:
- Serves files from the root directory of your `main` branch
- Updates your site whenever you push changes
- Makes your site available at `https://zkaidi19.github.io`

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- Check the **Actions** tab to see the deployment progress
- Your site will be live at: `https://zkaidi19.github.io`

## ⚡ Automatic Updates

Once set up, your website will automatically update whenever you:
1. Make changes to templates, CSS, or content
2. Commit and push to the `main` branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild the static files
4. Your live site will update within a few minutes

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### For Content Changes:
1. Edit templates in `/templates/` folder
2. Modify styles in `/static/css/style.css`
3. Update JavaScript in `/static/js/script.js`
4. Test locally: `uv run python run.py dev`
5. Generate static files: `uv run python build_static.py`
6. Commit and push changes

### For Major Updates:
1. Modify Flask routes in `app.py` if needed
2. Update the build script `build_static.py` if necessary
3. Test the static generation locally
4. Commit and push

## 📁 File Structure Explanation

```
├── *.html                 # Generated static pages (served by GitHub Pages)
├── api/                   # Static JSON data
├── static/                # CSS, JS, images
├── templates/             # Flask templates (source files)
├── app.py                 # Flask application (for development)
├── build_static.py        # Static site generator
├── .github/workflows/     # GitHub Actions for auto-generation
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Check that you pushed to the `main` branch
2. Verify your repository is named `zkaidi19.github.io` exactly
3. Check GitHub Actions tab for any build errors
4. Wait a few minutes - GitHub Pages can take time to update

### If changes don't appear:
1. Check if the build completed successfully in Actions
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Wait a few minutes for CDN propagation

### For development issues:
1. Run `uv sync` to ensure dependencies are installed
2. Test locally with `uv run python run.py dev`
3. Generate static files with `uv run python build_static.py`
